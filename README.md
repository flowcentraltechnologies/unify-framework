Unify Framework is a server-side component-based framework for developing web applications in Java. The entire framework is built on the concept of a pool of configurable components interacting with each other at runtime to provide complete application functionality.

The framework makes available, to the developer, a solid set of reusable and extensible software components built using simple high level abstractions that effectively hide the details of underlying complexities from the developer.

The framework aims to avoid the mishmash of varying technologies by providing a unified full stack platform.
